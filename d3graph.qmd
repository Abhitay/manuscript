This interactive map, created using D3.js, visualizes the global distribution of manuscripts across cities. Each orange circle represents a city, with its size proportional to the manuscript count. Users can explore the map by zooming, panning, or filtering cities by country using a dropdown menu. Hovering over a city reveals a tooltip displaying the city's name, manuscript count, and geographic coordinates. The map is built on a Mercator projection, converting geographic data into a 2D visualization. This dynamic and engaging design helps users understand the spatial trends in manuscript collections, enabling deeper exploration of regions and patterns that would be difficult to grasp from static visuals.
