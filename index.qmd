# Introduction

The Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) project provides a rich and multifaceted dataset, offering insights into the historical journey of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. These manuscripts, dispersed across libraries, archives, museums and galleries over centuries hold immense historical, cultural and academic significance. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in their movement, ownership and preservation. This dataset contains detailed information about manuscripts including their places of origin, former and current owners, time spans and collection affiliations . Through our exploration, we seek to address key questions such as: - How have these manuscripts traveled over time and across regions? - What patterns emerge in the transition of ownership and who were the key collectors and institutions preserving these texts reflect their historical context? Leveraging descriptive, temporal, geographic analyses we aim to map the trajectories of these manuscripts and shed light on the broader historical and cultural narratives they represent. This research helps us understand how knowledge was shared and preserved over time, showing why these texts are still important for historical studies today.
