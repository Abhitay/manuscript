# Introduction

The Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) project provides a rich and multifaceted dataset, offering insights into the historical journey of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. These manuscripts, dispersed across libraries, archives, museums, and galleries over centuries, hold immense historical, cultural, and academic significance. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in their movement, ownership, and preservation.

This dataset contains detailed information about manuscripts, including their places of origin, former and current owners, time spans, collection affiliations, and materials. Through our exploration, we seek to address key questions such as:
- How have these manuscripts traveled over time and across regions?
- What patterns emerge in the transition of ownership, and who were the key collectors and institutions preserving these texts?
- How does the material composition of these manuscripts, such as parchment, reflect their historical context and production?

Leveraging descriptive, temporal, geographic, and network analyses, we aim to map the trajectories of these manuscripts and shed light on the broader historical and cultural narratives they represent. This study not only contributes to understanding the dissemination and preservation of knowledge but also highlights the enduring relevance of these texts in shaping historical scholarship.
