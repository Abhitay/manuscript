This Chartulary above mentioned, and the present book are the oldest Evidence Books relating to the Estates of our Ancient Nobility that have as yet been discovered. The greatest part of this Chartulary was compiled before the year 1288, under the direction of the Lord John de Vallibus or Vaux. In the Volume is inserted loosely a Deed in the time of Henry II. making a Grant to Willelmo de Nowigo. Among the Witnesses recited are Robert (Querceto) Bishop of Lincoln. T.

Version and comment. of Rob. Grossteste. Cent. xiii""...acquired by Dr. Millar in 1920.""

It was written in bâtarde script in two columns of forty-six lines on folio-size parchment leaves, circa 1465-1475. The poem is divided into nine books, with seven of the book divisions marked with miniatures copied from Burgundian models. Other visual elements include large illuminated initials in gold on colored grounds at the beginning of each story and one-line initials with contrasting flourishing at the beginning of each stanza. The manuscript is incomplete, ending in book 9 with approximately 3200 lines (eighteen additional leaves) missing at the end.""",1501,16

Derolez 2003, pl. 55), some later modifications (probably fifteenth century) in black ink (e.g. fol. 1), rubrics in red, versals touched in red, red and blue paragraph marks, red and blue lombards at the beginning, two-line and one nine-line initials in red and blue with blue and red penwork throughout, FIVE ILLUMINATED INITIALS introducing each book, in varying colours on golden burnished grounds with figurated extensions towards lower margins, the extensions including one or two medallions with bust- or full portraits, the illuminations slightly flaked and rubbed, prickings all preserved, three wormholes to the last leaves, late fourteenth or early fifteenth century brown calf over wooden boards, blind tooled with geometric lines in diamond pattern, four small round stamps in the corners of front and back covers, sewn on five throngs, pastedowns removed? from the boards to serve as two of the four manuscript flyleaves, restoration to traces of a now missing clasp, some loss to spine.Contents:(ignoring pencil foliation)Fol. 1-59v: Incipit: ""Incipiunt capitula primi libri dialigorum beati gregorii papae"", explicit: ""...et fidentes dico que salutatis hostia ipsi fuerimus""; a later hand has added ""Explicit liber dialogorum beati gregorii pape deo gratias Amen"".Fol. 60: Probably originally blank, with a list of sacraments, the celestial order, vices and virtues.Fol. 60v-61: Probably originally blank, with a treatise on paradise and a meditation on the cross, most likely added in the fifteenth century.Fol. 61v: in a hand contemporary to the main text: List of prayers to be addressed to various saints in order to receive a certain number of indulgences from various popes.Fol. 62-70v: Bonaventura de Bagnoregios Legenda Minor Sancti Francisci, followed by the more exhaustive Legenda Maior Sancti Francisci. Incipit: ""Apparuit gratia dei salvatoris nostri diebus istis novissimis ...""; Explicit: ""Quo nos introducat verus populi ductor et Salvator, Christus Iesus crucifixus, per merita servi sui Francisci, ad laudem et gloriam unius Dei et trini, qui vivit et regnat in saecula saeculorum. Amen"".Provenance:1. The illumination and some contemporary amendments to the text suggest that the book was made for a convent of the Friars Minor, most likely of the Franciscan order in the Emilia Romagna.2. The manuscript was newly bound in the early fifteenth century as indicated by the added paper. Fol. 25 has a text insertion which starts ""Incipit testamentum quod fecit beatissimus pater nostrum Sanctus Franciscus propter obitum suum ...""; this, along with another added paragraph on St. Nicholas on fol. 27, indicates that the manuscript must have been part of a Franciscan library in the fifteenth century, where it was kept up to date.3.

Contains the text of the Epistles with probably three separate glosses, with part of the Apocalypse in a ?C15 hand at the end, a list of readings from the epistles at the front in a C14 hand. At the end is a pastedown from a Collectar, containing hymns and prayers; Gameson suggests it probably dates from c. 1050-75 and, given that it is incomplete and contains mistakes, it was probably rejected at an early stage of production. Probably written at Canterbury, and certainly in St Augustines Abbey library by the 13th century. Bequeathed to the cathedral by Major John Roland Abbey of Redlynch in 1969, but mislaid at Sothebys after the death of Mr Mayor, who was administering the Abbey estate. Only delivered 4 Jun 1979. Previously passed through the hands of Thomas Wylde (C16), FW (C17), Walter Sneyd, C H St John Hornby of Shelley House, Chelsea, and George Dunn of Woolley Hall, Maidenhead.
For discussion of the Collectar fragments, see R. Gameson, The Earliest Books of Canterbury Cathedral (London, 2008), pp. 120-125.
