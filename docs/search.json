    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) project provides a rich and multifaceted dataset, offering insights into the historical journey of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. These manuscripts, dispersed across libraries, archives, museums and galleries over centuries hold immense historical, cultural and academic significance. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in their movement, ownership and preservation. This dataset contains detailed information about manuscripts including their places of origin, former and current owners, time spans and collection affiliations . Through our exploration, we seek to address key questions such as: - How have these manuscripts traveled over time and across regions? - What patterns emerge in the transition of ownership and who were the key collectors and institutions preserving these texts reflect their historical context? Leveraging descriptive, temporal, geographic analyses we aim to map the trajectories of these manuscripts and shed light on the broader historical and cultural narratives they represent. This research helps us understand how knowledge was shared and preserved over time, showing why these texts are still important for historical studies today.",

These datasets are unified within the Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) knowledge graph, which uses SPARQL queries to retrieve data on manuscript IDs, locations, ownership history and physical attributes. The knowledge graph employs ontologies like Erlangen CIDOC-CRM (events), FRBRoo (bibliographic information) and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (locations) for semantic integration. The dataset is static, in tabular format (data.frame) with 494,271 rows and 14 columns, including manuscript IDs, provenance data, locations, ownership timelines, physical attributes and metadata like language and author names. Key challenges include significant missing values (e.g. manuscript dimensions, author names and languages) and inconsistencies arising from varying record-keeping practices across databases. The data will be imported into R using the readr package for cleaning and analysis, leveraging tools like dplyr and tidyr for transformation.\nSources include:",

This tells us that our dataset had many redundant rows present, particularly when using the manuscript column as a primary identifier. Such a high level of duplication suggests that considerable redundancy is in place, which can obscure the analysis and lead to misjudgment in columns like author_name, place_label, and catalog_number.\nAfter Duplicate Removal (Based on Manuscript): The “After Removal” plot gives an impressive improvement in the case of most of the columns. The column ‘manuscript’, now being the key column, has 0% duplicate value, which means that all the redundant rows corresponding to this key field have been removed. Other columns, such as the note column, show a sharp drop in duplication from 98.2% to 13.4%, indicating reduced redundancy in the associated data. Columns like author_name, catalog_number, and place_label retain 100% duplicates. This may indicate that these fields have a value consistent across multiple manuscripts or are inherently less variable, for example this means that one collector has more than one manuscript in their collection or for values such as height and width, as these are empty they show 100% duplicate values.",

The frequency declines sharply after the 1400s, coinciding with the invention of the printing press, which reduced the need for handwritten manuscripts.

A small proportion of missing values (NA) indicates incomplete data requiring further investigation.

Other parts of the world display minimal representation, with scattered yellow points indicating lower manuscript counts. This pattern highlights the centralization of manuscript preservation and cataloging efforts in Western countries, likely reflecting historical, cultural, and resource-related factors that prioritize these regions.",

Key locations like London, Leyden, and Paris show a consistent presence of manuscripts, especially during the 12th to 15th centuries, which aligns with the peak of manuscript production in the medieval period. Earlier centuries, particularly before the 9th century, have sparse representation, reflecting limited manuscript survival or production during those times. Locations such as New York show increased representation in later periods, likely due to modern cataloging and collection practices. This visualization highlights the central role of European locations in manuscript preservation while showcasing historical trends in manuscript production and collection efforts across different centuries.",

Each orange circle represents a city, with its size proportional to the manuscript count. Users can explore the map by zooming, panning, or filtering cities by country using a dropdown menu. Hovering over a city reveals a tooltip displaying the city’s name, manuscript count, and geographic coordinates. The map is built on a Mercator projection, converting geographic data into a 2D visualization. This dynamic and engaging design helps users understand the spatial trends in manuscript collections, enabling deeper exploration of regions and patterns that would be difficult to grasp from static visuals.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Our exploration of the manuscript dataset revealed valuable insights into the historical and geographic distribution of manuscripts, uncovering patterns in production, preservation, and collection practices. Centralization of collections in key European hubs like London, Paris, and Leyden was evident, with North America emerging as a significant modern hub. Temporal trends showed a peak in manuscript production during the medieval period (12th–15th centuries), followed by a sharp decline due to the advent of the printing press. The analysis highlighted the dominance of materials like parchment and paper, reflecting historical advancements and preservation needs. However, limitations such as incomplete data, lack of geographic granularity, and inherent biases favoring Western collections constrained the comprehensiveness of the study. Future work could focus on expanding global representation, filling data gaps, and integrating external datasets to provide richer context. This project emphasized the importance of data quality, effective visualizations, and addressing historical biases, showcasing the potential of data science to uncover cultural and historical trends while navigating the complexities of archival datasets.",
