    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) project provides a rich and multifaceted dataset, offering insights into the historical journey of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. These manuscripts, dispersed across libraries, archives, museums, and galleries over centuries, hold immense historical, cultural, and academic significance. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in their movement, ownership, and preservation.\nThis dataset contains detailed information about manuscripts, including their places of origin, former and current owners, time spans, collection affiliations, and materials. Through our exploration, we seek to address key questions such as: - How have these manuscripts traveled over time and across regions? - What patterns emerge in the transition of ownership, and who were the key collectors and institutions preserving these texts? - How does the material composition of these manuscripts, such as parchment, reflect their historical context and production?\nLeveraging descriptive, temporal, geographic, and network analyses, we aim to map the trajectories of these manuscripts and shed light on the broader historical and cultural narratives they represent. This study not only contributes to understanding the dissemination and preservation of knowledge but also highlights the enduring relevance of these texts in shaping historical scholarship.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset for this project integrates records from three major specialist databases: the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (241,000 manuscript histories, representing 195,000 unique entries), the Bibale Database (13,000 records from the Institute for Research and History of Texts, France), and the Medieval Manuscripts Catalogue from the Bodleian Libraries (12,000 records from the University of Oxford). These databases are unified into a knowledge graph leveraging ontologies like Erlangen CIDOC-CRM (events), FRBRoo (bibliographic information), and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (locations). The data was extracted using SPARQL queries on the Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) knowledge graph, allowing retrieval of key attributes like manuscript IDs, locations, ownership details, and manuscript dimensions. The dataset is structured in a tabular format with columns such as place_label, former_owner_name, current_owner_name, begin, end, and collection_label. Despite its richness, the dataset poses challenges like missing values and inconsistencies in location data, which will be addressed during preprocessing. This dataset offers a unique opportunity to analyze the provenance, movement, and historical significance of manuscripts across time and space.\nThe data is structured in tabular form with columns such as: - place_label: The geographic location of the manuscript. - former_owner_name: The manuscript’s previous owner. - current_owner_name: The manuscript’s current owner. - begin / end: Time periods indicating when ownership was recorded. - collection_label: Name of the collection housing the manuscript. - author_name: The author of the manuscript. - language: The language the manuscript is written in.",

However, moderate gaps in former_owner_name, note, and con_label, indicate incomplete provenance records that may limit the depth of historical analysis. Manuscript attributes such as width_value, height_value, language, and author_name exhibit significant missing rates of 100%, reflecting gaps in data availability. These patterns underscore the importance of addressing missing data, either through imputation or exclusion, to maintain analytical integrity while highlighting opportunities for enhancing future data digitization and preservation efforts.",
