    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) project provides a rich and multifaceted dataset, offering insights into the historical journey of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. These manuscripts, dispersed across libraries, archives, museums and galleries over centuries hold immense historical, cultural and academic significance. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to uncover patterns in their movement, ownership and preservation. This dataset contains detailed information about manuscripts including their places of origin, former and current owners, time spans and collection affiliations . Through our exploration, we seek to address key questions such as: - How have these manuscripts traveled over time and across regions? - What patterns emerge in the transition of ownership and who were the key collectors and institutions preserving these texts reflect their historical context? Leveraging descriptive, temporal, geographic analyses we aim to map the trajectories of these manuscripts and shed light on the broader historical and cultural narratives they represent. This research helps us understand how knowledge was shared and preserved over time, showing why these texts are still important for historical studies today.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset for this project integrates records from three major sources: the Schoenberg Database of Manuscripts (241,000 records, representing 195,000 unique manuscript histories), the Bibale Database (13,000 records curated by the Institute for Research and History of Texts, France) and the Medieval Manuscripts Catalogue from the Bodleian Libraries (12,000 records from the University of Oxford). These datasets are unified within the Mapping Manuscript Migrations (MMM) knowledge graph, which uses SPARQL queries to retrieve data on manuscript IDs, locations, ownership history and physical attributes. The knowledge graph employs ontologies like Erlangen CIDOC-CRM (events), FRBRoo (bibliographic information) and the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (locations) for semantic integration. The dataset is static, in tabular format (data.frame) with 494,271 rows and 14 columns, including manuscript IDs, provenance data, locations, ownership timelines, physical attributes and metadata like language and author names. Key challenges include significant missing values (e.g. manuscript dimensions, author names and languages) and inconsistencies arising from varying record-keeping practices across databases. The data will be imported into R using the readr package for cleaning and analysis, leveraging tools like dplyr and tidyr for transformation.\nSources include:",

However, moderate gaps in former_owner_name, note, and con_label, indicate incomplete provenance records that may limit the depth of historical analysis. Manuscript attributes such as width_value, height_value, language, and author_name exhibit significant missing rates of 100%, reflecting gaps in data availability. These patterns underscore the importance of addressing missing data, either through imputation or exclusion, to maintain analytical integrity while highlighting opportunities for enhancing future data digitization and preservation efforts.",
